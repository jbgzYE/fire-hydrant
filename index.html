    <div id="text-overlay02">I consider myself a new media artist and filmmaker. In my art practice, I incorporate
      different media to wander across the boundary between the digital world and the physical
      world. By adopting digital thinking when creating works, I aim to discover the countless
      possibilities brought by emerging technologies. Many of my works combine digital elements
      such as icons and interfaces of the computer system with the actual world.</div>


    <div id="text-overlay">1. How do I measure my growth as an artist when success is often intangible, such as personal satisfaction or conceptual breakthroughs, versus more quantifiable achievements like sales or followers?<br>

      2. How do I maintain the integrity of my artistic vision when working on commissions or client projects that may not fully align with my values? When should I stand my ground, and when is compromise necessary?<br>

      3. How do I position myself as both a student of traditional art and digital technologies in an industry that requires constant innovation and adaptability? Can my dual background become an asset rather than a point of tension?<br>
      4. How do I navigate self-promotion in an era where social media is crucial for visibility but potentially dilutes the essence of my work? How can I let my art speak for itself in a noisy digital space?<br>
      5. How can I explore themes of animism without appropriating cultural symbols or beliefs that I do not have a personal connection to? What research and respect are necessary for a thoughtful, responsible approach?<br>
      6. How do I balance creating work for myself with catering to an audience or market? Can I maintain creative integrity while also making work that resonates with others?<br>
      7. How do I manage the fear of failure or irrelevance in a creative field that often rewards risk-taking? How can I build resilience when experimentation leads to results that aren’t always successful?<br>
      8. How can I ensure financial stability as an artist without becoming overly reliant on the commodification of my art? What alternative income streams align with my creative practice?<br>
      9. How do I balance my personal exploration of esoteric or experimental themes with the commercial demands of the art world? Can niche explorations coexist with broader appeal?<br>
      10. How do I weave my skills in videography and photography into my 3D art in a way that feels seamless and complementary rather than forced or disjointed?<br>
      11. How do I create immersive and interactive 3D art that emotionally and intellectually resonates with audiences? Can I build spaces that feel alive and responsive to the viewer's experience?<br>
      12. To what extent should I align my work with current trends in both art and tech? How can I avoid becoming pigeonholed or sacrificing my artistic identity for the sake of relevance?<br>
      13. How can I merge the functionality of UI/UX design with my more artistic and conceptual work? Can I explore creative freedom in a field driven by user-friendly interfaces and practicality?<br>
      </div>

    <div id="text-overlay03">14. How do I handle the tension between creating work that is deeply personal and making it accessible or relatable to a broader audience? Can my identity inform my art without becoming too autobiographical?<br>
        15. How do I push beyond the academic frameworks I’ve learned as a student while still applying valuable lessons from formal training? Can I forge a unique path that respects tradition while challenging its limitations?<br>
        16. What ethical considerations should I be aware of when addressing themes of surveillance, especially in a world where privacy is constantly under threat? Can I engage with this subject without glorifying it?<br>
        17. How do I manage feelings of imposter syndrome as I transition into UI/UX design and build confidence in the new skills I am learning without feeling overwhelmed?<br>
        18. How do I maintain a healthy work-life balance when the boundaries between personal exploration and professional output blur, especially in a career that is deeply tied to my identity?<br>
        19. How do I position myself as an artist who challenges the dominant narratives of the art world while still navigating power dynamics with galleries, collectors, and institutions?<br>
        20. How do I maintain autonomy in my work while pursuing collaborations in a field that demands both independence and teamwork?<br>
        21. What role does my identity play in my art, and how can I weave personal themes into my work without making it overly autobiographical or limiting its broader relevance?<br>
        22. How do I create art that addresses social and political issues, particularly around themes of surveillance and digital ethics, without becoming too didactic or preachy?<br>
        23. What kind of artistic legacy do I want to leave behind, and how can I build that in a digital age where work can be easily replicated or forgotten? What does enduring relevance look like for me?<br>
        24. How can I ensure that my art—particularly in areas like cosmos, animism, and surveillance—retains its depth and relevance in a world saturated with similar themes?<br>
        25. How do I respond to feedback from mentors, peers, or clients that contradicts my vision? When do I compromise, and when do I hold firm to my artistic direction?</div>
